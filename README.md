# MeshTastic Solar Node BOM

Quick readme on how to build a solar powered Meshtastic node for minimal cost. There are many versions of this out there, but this one is mine.

# Parts Required

## Case

Casing's are 12 euros for 4.

## Solar Panel

There's three versions, the USB-C is easiest for direct powering of the T114, but you can equally choose any and cut the wires off and connect it directly to the battery terminals on the T114 which will give you a voltage readout instead of just showing powered.

## Antennas

Any of the Gizont antennas are great and will mount perfectly in the cases. I prefer the longer version, but you can choose whatever's cheapest and the performance will be great.

## The Node

In my original version I used an old T-Echo with the case removed, but the T114 will fit better in the case and performs the same or better. Choose whatever's cheapest, there's no need for a GPS for a fixed node, though it'll be used for setting the time for the node if present. Screen is also not necessary, nor is the case.

## Cells

You can use any old 18650's you have laying around, including those salvaged from a laptop or old drill. If you need to buy some then go for LiFePo4 which are most suitable for this application.

## Mounting

To camoflage and mount to the tree or wherever, this tape is a great idea.

# Build Tips

The antenna will mount into one of the two waterproof connectors, leaving the housing watertight but giving the Gizont a fairly robust mounting point.
